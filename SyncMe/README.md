# SyncMe
### Description:
This project was built for a Technical Task I needed to complete. It's a folder replication tool, 
where the user should provide the folder he wants to replicate, the destination folder and also the sync time interval.
I decided to built it with Python, the language I've been working with for the last few months, regarding a Python Bootcamp I'm enrolled. 
I took the opportunity to practice a little bit with Tkinter module and end up building this project with a graphical interface, hope you enjoy it! :)
### Procedures
On "dist" folder you will find the following files:
```
main.exe
logo.png
favicon.ico

```
The App is already built with "pyinstaller", you can just run "main.exe" and try it!

When you run the App you will find a simple interface, with 4 inputs: "Source Folder", "Replica Folder", "Logs Folder and "Sync Time".
After you define all of them, just click on "Sync Folder" button, and voil√°, it's running.
Hope you appreciate it!
